# Automatic-Insulin-Pump-System
## Introduction
* Diabetes Mellitus (DM), which is usually referred to Diabetes, is a worldwide chronic metabolic disorder that involves abnormal blood glucose levels, which can cause diverse health disorders that affect their heart, weakness, and dizziness, while too much can lead to vision and nerve problems, kidney disease, and strokes.
